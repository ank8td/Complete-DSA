/* Fast pointer and slow pointer method :->
   This method basically used to detect cycle in array or linkedlist.
   Also used to find the node in the cycle etc.
   There are basically two possiblities:->
   FastPointer->SlowPointer in next move fast and slow both point to same location hence cycle detected.
   FastPointer->->SlowPointer then in next step FastPointer->SlowPointer then in one next round both lies at same location the cycle detect.
